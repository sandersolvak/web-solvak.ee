Not investigative journalism, but the fast sensationalist media bombarding us with “bite-sized” bullets of news that’s designed to interrupt and mislead and in the end leave us desensitized and in chronic stress</p>
				<p>Libre Franklin Light at 16pt. Folders are hard. They’re hard in the sense of the mental burden of organising information into deep hierarchies. Coming up with a logical structure and navigating it later takes mental energy. Much like the simple fact of having gears on your bike reserves some of your brain to constantly think about them. You may not notice it and if someone tried to tell you it’s so, you might even disagree. It’s such a small and unnoticeable thing. But these things add up, and you really should use your brain for more important stuff.

You must care about the French toast. If you don’t care about the French toast, then perhaps you don’t care about anything.""

Deleting a group would not.</p>
