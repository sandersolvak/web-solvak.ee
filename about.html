			<p>Hi, I'm Sander Solvak, a designer based in Tallinn, Estonia. For over 15 years I've helped clients both big and small with websites, apps, design systems, branding, books and more.</p>
			<p>I believe in keeping things clean and simple, love finding elegant solutions to problems and try leave things better than I found them.</p>
			<p>I'm currently leading design and changing fintech at <a href="https://www.funderbeam.com">Funderbeam.</a> Previously, I was a design generalist at Playtech, working on everything from tradeshows and print designs of all shapes and sizes to websites and user interfaces. Time permitting, I still occasionally take on freelance projects.</p>
			<p>My time off is spent with <a href="https://letterboxd.com/sandersolvak/">movies,</a> cooking, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sandersolvak/albums">travelling,</a> on my bike or taking pictures.</p>
