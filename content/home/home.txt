My name is Sander and I’m a designer based in Tallinn, Estonia. I’ve helped clients both big and small with websites, apps, design systems, branding, installations, books and more. Currently design manager at [Funderbeam](https://www.funderbeam.com/). I like to keep things clean and simple, love [movies](https://letterboxd.com/sandersolvak/), food, [travelling](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sandersolvak/albums), bicycles and making pictures.

Thanks for stopping by, have a very nice day!
