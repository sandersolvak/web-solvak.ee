Intro:

Hi, I'm Sander Solvak, a multi-disciplinary designer based in Tallinn, Estonia. For over 15 years I've helped clients both big and small with websites, apps, design systems, branding, books and more.

I believe in keeping things clean and simple, love finding elegant solutions to problems and try to leave things better than I found them.

I'm currently leading design and changing fintech at (link: https://www.funderbeam.com text: Funderbeam.) Previously, I was a design generalist at Playtech, working on everything from trade-shows and print designs of all shapes and sizes to websites and user interfaces. Time permitting, I still occasionally take on freelance projects.

My time off is spent with (link: https://www.letterboxd.com/sandersolvak/ text: movies,) cooking, travelling, on my bike or (link: /photo text: taking pictures.)
