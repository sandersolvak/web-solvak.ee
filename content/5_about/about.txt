Intro:

Hi, I'm Sander Solvak, a designer based in Tallinn, Estonia. For over 15 years I've helped clients both big and small with websites, apps, design systems, branding, books and more.

I believe in keeping things clean and simple, love finding elegant solutions to problems and try leave things better than I found them.

I'm currently leading design and changing fintech at [Funderbeam.](https://www.funderbeam.com) Previously, I was a design generalist at Playtech, working on everything from tradeshows and print designs of all shapes and sizes to websites and user interfaces. Time permitting, I still occasionally take on freelance projects.

My time off is spent with [movies,](https://www.letterboxd.com/sandersolvak/) cooking, [travelling,](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sandersolvak/albums) on my bike or taking pictures.
