Intro:

Hi, I'm Sander Solvak, a multi-disciplinary designer based in Tallinn, Estonia. For over 20 years I've helped clients both big and small by designing things on and around screens â€“ products, interfaces, experiences, systems, processes.

I strive to extract clarity from ambiguity, and find elegant, thoughtful solutions to problems. I want to put care and consideration into the things I work on and leave them better than I found them.

I'm currently changing fintech as principal designer at (link: https://www.funderbeam.com text: Funderbeam.) Previously, I was a design generalist at Playtech, working on everything from trade-shows and print designs of all shapes and sizes to websites and user interfaces. Time permitting, I still occasionally take on freelance projects.

My time off is spent with (link: https://www.letterboxd.com/sandersolvak/ text: movies,) cooking, travelling, (link: /photo text: taking pictures), or on a bicycle.

Toward better.
