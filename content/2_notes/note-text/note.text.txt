The groups would be collapsible and show how many files they hold just like the current way groups work in <a href="#">Windows 7.</a> You could rename a group any time and also change itâ€™s color, for example you could decide that groups containing preview files are always blue and groups of client files are red, making them easy to distinguish by a glance. Deleting a group would not.
