This is zaku zaku, japanese for the crunching sound that stepping on ice might make. It’s one of a set of chocolates designed to represent japanese words for certain textures, by studio (link: http://www.nendo.jp/jp/works/chocolatexture/?release text: Nendo target: _blank) for the Maison et Objet design show in Paris. Go see the rest of them on Nendo’s site because they’re all fantastic.
