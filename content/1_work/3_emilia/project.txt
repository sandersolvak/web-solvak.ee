A refreshing change from digital products, I had the chance to art direct and design two lovely children's books written written by [Liz Bowen](http://www.lizbowen-cercone.com) and illustrated by [Kristi Kindel.](http://www.behance.net/kristik) “Emilia and Percy” follows Emilia and her toy penguin Percy as they set out to help a  squirrel in the middle of the winter in New York's Central Park. “Tilly, Tilly, Twinkle Toes” is a crazy story about Matilda and her favourite toy Lambsy Loo Loo, and their chaotic adventures before bedtime.

Both books are available in large format hardcover editions as well as e-books.
