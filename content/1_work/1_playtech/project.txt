Marketing brochure for Playtech, showcasing the entire product suite offered by the global gaming software and services company.
My role was to design and layout the brochure, to find, create or commission artwork to accompany the copy and to make sure everything goes smoothly through print. In addition to the brochure I also designed a digital games catalogue to go with it as well as graphics for Playtech's booth that year at the biggest annual industry trade-show.
