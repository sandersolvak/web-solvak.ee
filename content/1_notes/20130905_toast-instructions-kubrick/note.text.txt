An Excerpt from "Some Instructions to the New Guy Concerning the Preparation and Presentation of My French Toast", by Stanley Kubrick.

>Chestnut brown crust marks are an indication that great  care has gone into preparing the French toast, and above all, this is  what concerns me the most: that you care. You must care about the French  toast. If you don’t care about the French toast, then perhaps you don’t  care about anything is my train of thought on the matter, and if you  don’t care about anything, then working for me doesn’t seem feasible, as  I have an insatiable desire to be surrounded by people who care as much  as I do.
