Intro: My buddy (link: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-pooley-34921581/ text: Tom Pooley) approached me with the idea to develop a brand for his freelance copywriting and marketer antics.

----

Text: Every job Tom takes on, is all about conversations. It all starts with a conversation two people have that leads one of them to have conversations with him, and once Tom has done his thing, continues with many more conversations elsewhere. What does a conversation look like? Naturally, it's a chat bubble. And a chat bubble coincidentally looks a little like the letter P, like in Pooley.

Whatever your business or the project at hand, there's a story somewhere in there that you need to tell your audience. Tom has experience and ideas, and wants to put them to work telling _your_ story, so you can have many, many more conversations.

I kept the colour palette a simple twosome of black with a bit of vibrant blue (Plack and Plue ;).

For the typeface, I was looking for something to match Toms outgoing and talkative personality. The typeface I landed on is, coincidentally, I swear, called Decibel, with weights ranging from normal to louderer, to loudest.
