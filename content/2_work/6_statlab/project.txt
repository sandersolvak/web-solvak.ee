Title: Website for Statlab

Text:

They already had a basic visual identity in place, defined by a strong, deep tone of red and condensed type — a simple, solid foundation to build upon.

I translated their look and feel to the web and created a set of animated illustrations to complement the brief paragraphs about different methods of data analysis and hint at various ways Statlab can visualise the data.

All SVG illustrations that are animated are using [SMIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronized_Multimedia_Integration_Language?oldformat=true). There was no particular reason for choosing SMIL over CSS or JS to animate besides me being up to my elbows in all things SVG at the time.
